# About VTubers.me Web App (Not Final Name)
VTubers.me Web App is a small progressive web app for browsing VTubers.me and interacting with various parts of the site. I have made this open-source as I would like people to help on this project and add new features.

The goal is to create a decent way to use VTubers.me with extra functions not currently found on the website as well as an easier way to access the site.
